 Console Screen is a very useful command that can be used to multiplex a physical console between several processes (typically interactive shells). It offers a user to open several separate session instances inside a one single terminal.
 Visual Studio provides rich support for JavaScript development, both using JavaScript directly, and also using the TypeScript, an open-source language which builds on JavaScript and is often used in large size web app development.
